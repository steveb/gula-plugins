The Vibey
=========

An LV2 plugin which is a combination of vibrato and tremolo. The depth of each
can be controlled and the phase offset of the vibrato can be set relative to
the tremolo.

To build the plugin you will require a working `Faust installation`_. The LV2
shared library can then be built by running::

  make

This will result in the `vibey.lv2` directory being ready to be copied to the
desired LV2 plugin directory.
